        <h1>welcome to Apnamart</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the Apnamart. We are provide the best products on the Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG). FMCGs have a short shelf life because of high consumer demand (e.g., soft drinks and confections) or because they are perishable (e.g., meat, dairy products, and baked goods).
          These goods are purchased frequently, are consumed rapidly, are priced low, and are sold in large quantities. They also have a high turnover when they're on the shelf at the store. Con></p>
